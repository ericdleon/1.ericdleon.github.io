<center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
<p>	I'm a Computer Science student at Rutgers University New Brunswick. I enjoy learning new skills that will help me advance towards becoming a developer. I also enjoy going to hackathons where I can learn new skills and create projects with other CS Students. I'm really interested in Web Development, App Development, and Game Development, and I've also been getting into developing apps involving Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.</p>

<p> I'm skilled in the Java language. I am familiar with HTML, Javascript, CSS. I am familiar with using tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, Unity, Blender, and the Command Line/Vim.</p>

<center><h1>Hobbies</h1></center>
<p>	In my free time I focus on gaining new skills by developing pseudo-applications and websites. I like going to hackathons. I like to develop Virtual Reality games and aplications and so far have been doing so at hackathons. Outside my CS related hobbies I enjoy playing tennis, badminton, ping pong, and watching youtube videos/Netflix.</p>
