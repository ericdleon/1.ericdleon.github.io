<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Computer Science student at Rutgers University New Brunswick. I enjoy learning new skills that will help me advance towards becoming a developer. I also enjoy going to hackathons where I can learn new skills and create projects with other CS Students. I'm really interested in Web Development, App Development, and Game Development, and I've also been getting into developing apps involving Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I'm very familiar with Java, and using both the Eclipse and IntelliJ platforms. I'm also familiar with using the command line/Vim and using Unity and Blender.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>In my free time I focus on gaining new skills by developing pseudo-applications and websites because I want to improve my skills and expose myself to new things. I also like going to hackathons where I can create projects with others. I've very interested in Augmented and Virtual Reality and so far have been concentrated in creates VR games during hackathons. Outside my CS related hobbies I enjoy playing tennis, badminton, ping pong, watching youtube videos/Netflix, and traveling. </p>
